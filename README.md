## Hello there 👋

I'm Jason, a Gameplay Engineer based in California.

I design and build games primarily in Unity.

Primary tech stack: C# and Unity for gameplay systems and tools, with supporting experience in C++, Lua (Roblox), Unreal Engine, and Python, plus strong debugging, iteration, and collaborative development workflows.

I've shipped several games on my own and through my education. My favorite is Summit on Roblox.
